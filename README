TiGeofence Javascript Module Example
Author: Bert Grantges

Special Credit goes to Steven Ou for his Obj-C code found here:

Overview: 
This application allows you to create hotspots and setup iOS to monitor those spots for geofencing. 

Important Note:
- The GeolocationModule.mm file under the Classes folder should be copied into the build/iphone/Classes folder of the generated XCode project
- For successful builds, I have found that this project must also be built using XCode


Requires Titanium Mobile SDK 2.0.1+
